# Supported Platforms

## Browsers

IE is not supported.

Modern browsers such as `Edge`, `Firefox`, `Chrome`, `Safari` is tested on the latest 2 versions.

No strict tests are be implemented on other versions due to the constraint of develop resources, but naive-ui is expected to work on those browsers which version is not too old (eg. in 2 years). If you find any problem please feel free to create an issue.

## Vue

Only Vue 3 (>3.0.5) is supported.

## TypeScript

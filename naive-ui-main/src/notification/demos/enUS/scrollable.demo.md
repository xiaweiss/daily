# Scrollable

If there are too many notifications, notifications container can be scrollable. However, in that case they will overlay a bit more area than them look, which will block some mouse events near notifications. If you don't want the feature, you can set `<n-notification-provider :scrollable="false" />` to make it unscrollable.

Change the property will cause all existing notifications to be cleaned, so please make sure you change this property at proper time.

```html
<n-button @click="handleClick">See how it scrolls</n-button>
```

```js
import { useNotification } from 'naive-ui'
import { defineComponent } from 'vue'

export default defineComponent({
  setup () {
    const notification = useNotification()
    return {
      handleClick (scrollable) {
        Array.apply(null, { length: 5 }).forEach(() =>
          notification.create({
            title: 'Many Notifications',
            content: `Try to scroll
Try to scroll
Try to scroll
Try to scroll
Try to scroll
Try to scroll
Try to scroll`
          })
        )
      }
    }
  }
})
```

# Use trigger width

Set `width="trigger"` to make popover's width the same as its trigger.

```html
<n-popover width="trigger">
  <template #trigger>
    <n-button>I would like to leave this city</n-button>
  </template>
  This old town don't smell too pretty and I can feel the warning signs running
  around my mind
</n-popover>
```
